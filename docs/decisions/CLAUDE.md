# Architectural Decision Records

> **Moved**: All ADRs have been migrated to `/docs/architecture/decisions/` using date-based naming convention.

## New Location

See [ADR Index](/docs/architecture/decisions/README.md) for the complete list of architectural decision records.

## Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
```

- **Date**: Decision date (not creation date)
- **Slug**: Lowercase, hyphen-separated description
- **No sequential numbers**: Avoids git merge conflicts
