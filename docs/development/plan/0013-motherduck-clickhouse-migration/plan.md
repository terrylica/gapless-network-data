# Plan 0013: MotherDuck to ClickHouse AWS Migration

**ADR ID**: 0013
**Status**: In Progress
**Created**: 2025-11-24
**Related MADR**: `docs/decisions/0013-motherduck-clickhouse-migration.md`

## (a) Context

**Why This Plan Exists**:

MotherDuck trial ending in 2-3 days requires urgent migration to ClickHouse Cloud AWS. Current infrastructure:

**Production Data**:

- 23.84M Ethereum blocks (verified 2025-11-20 via MotherDuck)
- ~1.5 GB storage (76-100 bytes/block)
- Dual-pipeline: BigQuery hourly (578 blocks/run) + Alchemy real-time (12s intervals)

**Infrastructure to Migrate**:
| Component | File | MotherDuck Usage |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| VM Real-Time Collector | `deployment/vm/realtime_collector.py` | Line 121: `duckdb.connect('md:')` |
| Cloud Run Batch Updater | `deployment/cloud-run/main.py` | Line 136: `duckdb.connect('md:')` |
| Data Quality Checker | `deployment/cloud-run/data_quality_checker.py` | Lines 70-73 |
| Gap Monitor Function | `deployment/gcp-functions/motherduck-monitor/main.py` | Line 361 |

**ClickHouse Target**:

- Service: ClickHouse Cloud (managed AWS)
- Status: Provisioned but untested
- Credentials: Doppler `aws-credentials/prd` (8 secrets)

**Constraints**:

- Zero downtime required
- 2-3 days to trial expiration
- Fail-fast error policy (exception-only)
- 6-12 hour compressed validation

## (b) Plan

**Objective**: Migrate 23.84M Ethereum blocks and 4 production pipelines from MotherDuck to ClickHouse AWS with zero downtime.

**Strategy**: Dual-write (both databases active during migration, safe rollback at every stage)

**Timeline** (2.5 days compressed):

### Day 0 (TODAY) - Pre-Migration & Historical Load

| Hour | Task                           | Success Criteria                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0-1  | Validate ClickHouse connection | Query returns result, write succeeds         |
| 1-2  | Create ClickHouse schema       | Table created with ReplacingMergeTree        |
| 2-6  | Historical data migration      | 23.84M rows in ClickHouse, row count matches |

### Day 1 - Dual-Write Deployment

| Hour | Task                           | Success Criteria                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 0-2  | Update 4 production components | Code changes complete, tests pass      |
| 2-4  | Deploy to GCP                  | VM, Cloud Run, Cloud Function deployed |
| 4-16 | Compressed validation          | Hourly consistency checks pass         |

### Day 2 - Cutover & Deprecation

| Hour | Task                   | Success Criteria                        |
| ---- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0-2  | Read cutover           | SDK/monitoring reads from ClickHouse    |
| 2-4  | MotherDuck deprecation | Writes stopped, final snapshot archived |

**Rollback Strategy**:

- Before Day 1 Hour 4: No changes to production (revert branch)
- Day 1-2: Revert to MotherDuck-only (dual-write continues, switch reads back)
- After Day 2: MotherDuck archived in GCS (30-day retention for emergency recovery)

## (c) Task List

### Phase 0: Validation (Day 0, Hour 0-1) ✅ COMPLETED

**0.1 Validate ClickHouse connection using Doppler credentials** ✅ COMPLETED

- Command: `doppler run --project aws-credentials --config prd -- uv run scripts/clickhouse/validate_connection.py`
- Result: Connection succeeded, server version 25.8.1.8702
- Validated: 2025-11-24T23:20:10
- Output: `/tmp/clickhouse-validation.txt`

### Phase 1: Schema & Historical Migration (Day 0, Hour 1-6) ✅ COMPLETED
